He was the fourth of five children of Count Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy, a veteran of the Patriotic War of 1812, and Countess Mariya Tolstaya (Volkonskaya). Tolstoy's parents died when he was young, so he and his siblings were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at Kazan University. His teachers described him as \"both unable and unwilling to learn.\" Tolstoy left university in the middle of his studies, returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much of his time in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the Caucasus and joined the army. It was about this time that he started writing.</span></p>",

<p>Throughout the 1850s Goncharov was working on his second novel, but the process was slow for many reasons. In 1855 he took the post of a censor in the Saint Petersburg censorship committee. In this capacity he's done a lot of good: helped publish important works by Ivan Turgenev, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Pisemsky and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, which caused resentment by some of his bosses. According to Pisemsky, for giving a permission for his A Thousand Souls novel to be published, Goncharov has been officially reprimanded. Despite of all this, Goncharov has found himself a target of many satires and got a negative mention in Hertzen's Kolokol. \"One of the best Russian author shouldn&rsquo;t have taken upon himself this sort of a job\", critic Aleksander Druzhinin wrote in his diary. In 1856, as the official line in the publishing policy hardened, Goncharov quit the job.</p>",
